Challenges Faced
Managing Image Loading States: Implementing a spinner while images are loading was tricky, especially when dealing with multiple image sources. Ensuring smooth user experience during load times was essential.

Creating a Dynamic and Responsive UI: Designing the UI to be fully responsive across different devices required deep understanding of CSS Flexbox and Grid and thorough testing across various screen sizes.

Data Fetching and Error Handling: Integrating with an external API for product data and handling potential errors (like network issues) required robust error-handling mechanisms.

Organizing the Project Structure: As new features were added, the project structure required continuous refactoring to maintain clarity and adherence to best practices.

Lessons Learned
Importance of Clean Code and Documentation: Writing modular, well-documented code made the development process smoother and easier to debug. This also simplified adding new features and ensuring future maintainability.

Handling Asynchronous Operations in React: Gained a better understanding of managing asynchronous operations, especially using hooks like useEffect for data fetching and handling state updates.

Next.js Proficiency: Deepened knowledge of file-based routing, server-side rendering (SSR), and client-side rendering (CSR), optimizing Next.js applications for performance and scalability.

User-Centric Design Focus: The value of providing feedback to users, such as spinners for loading states, was reinforced. It significantly enhances the user experience.

New Features
Review Sorting Options:
Sort by Date: Reviews can now be sorted by newest or oldest.
Sort by Rating: Sort reviews by highest or lowest rating, allowing users to quickly assess the best and worst-rated products.
Improved Error Handling: Clearer error messages are displayed when product data fails to load, providing users with better feedback.
Future Improvements
Add a Shopping Cart: Implement a feature for users to add products, review their selections, and proceed to checkout.

User Authentication: Introduce user authentication, allowing users to create accounts, save favorite items, and view their order history.

Enhanced Search and Filtering: Implement advanced search functionality with multiple filters (e.g., price range, categories, tags) to improve product discoverability.
